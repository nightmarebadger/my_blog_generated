Of course I first found and tested out [Pygame](http://www.pygame.org/), but for some reason, it didn't exactly click with me, so I continued looking. I later came across the before-mentioned Pyglet and found it to be really nice and very suited for my needs and tastes. So, let's look at how we can make a very simple game with Pyglet.\n",

On top of all that, the application already listens for key presses and clicks (try pressing *ESC* to see how it works). So I believe that even this is a good start. "
