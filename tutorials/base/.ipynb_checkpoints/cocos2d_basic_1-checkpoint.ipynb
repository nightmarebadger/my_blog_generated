      "* **Flow control**: Manage the flow control between different scenes in an easy way\n",

      "* **Effects**: Effects like waves, twirl, lens and much more\n",
      "* **Tiled Maps**: Support for rectangular and hexagonal tiled maps\n",
      "* **Transitions**: Move from scene to scene with style\n",
      "* **Menus**: Built in classes to create menus\n",
      "* **Text Rendering**: Label and HTMLLabel with action support\n",
      "* **Documentation**: Programming Guide + API Reference + Video Tutorials + Lots of simple tests showing how to use it\n",
