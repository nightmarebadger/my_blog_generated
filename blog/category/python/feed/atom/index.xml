<p><a href="http://www.blender.org/"><img src="/images/blender_logo.png" alt="Blender"></a></p>
<h3 id="what-is-blender">What is Blender?</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.blender.org/">Blender</a> is a free and open source 3D animation suite. It supports the
entirety of the 3D pipeline—modeling, rigging, animation, simulation,
rendering, compositing and motion tracking, even video editing and game
creation. Advanced users employ Blender’s API for Python scripting to customize
the application and write specialized tools; often these are included in
Blender’s future releases. Blender is well suited to individuals and small
studios who benefit from its unified pipeline and responsive development
process. Examples from many Blender-based projects are available in the
showcase.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Even though at the beginning Blender was often criticised as not being up to
industry standards (especially on it's interface), but since Blender 2.5 was
released in 2011 with a completely reworked user interface it can easily sit
beside the major players such as Maya, 3ds Max etc.</p>
<p>It is also noted as the most all-around solution with the most extensive
feature set (and keep in mind that Maya and Max are around 3500$ each, so
that's another plus for Blender).</p>
<p>Blender has been growing in popularity even in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blender_(software)#Use_in_the_media_industry">media
industry</a>,
with more and more bigger projects opting to use it instead of the "standard"
tools.</p>
<h3 id="where-is-python-used">Where is Python used?</h3>
<p>The feature that makes Blender stand out the most is it's Python API, which
allows anyone to easily create scripts/addons, many of which are <a href="http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Extensions:2.6/Py/Scripts">integrated
into later
releases</a>. Since
I'm totally clueless about anything design-related, I can't tell you which ones
are good and useful, so I guess Google is your friend here :).</p>
<p>With Python and the included <code>bge</code> module you can even use Blender to create
games.</p>
<h3 id="examples-of-videos">Examples of videos</h3>
<p>Since Blender is primarily an animation suite, you can find many <a href="http://www.blenderguru.com/27-inspiring-blender-animations-that-will-make-your-jaw-drop/">great Blender animations</a> on the web.</p>
<p>Every 1-2 years the Blender Foundation announces a new creative project to help
drive Blender and it's innovation forward. Below you can find it's latest project, the <a href="http://mango.blender.org/">Tears of Steel</a>. Ignore the (imo) so-so acting and (again, imo) not the best story and focus on the animations ;).</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/OHOpb2fS-cM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>PS: It even comes in a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXzYqf_fuw4">Chinese
version</a>, using their own actors
but re-using the animations.</p>
<h3 id="examples-of-games">Examples of games</h3>
<p>While there are quite some games made in Blender, not many of them achieved
global recognition. Below is a trailer from <a href="http://deadcyborg.com/index.html">Dead
Cyborg</a>, a Steam Greenlit free donation based
oldskool sci-fi adventure game. I've read good things about it, so I'll be sure
to check it out when I get the chance.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/pex1R67yLXA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>I've also found Mattline1's <a href="http://mattline1.blogspot.co.uk/">blog</a> and
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Mattline1">videos</a> really nice - lots of nicely
implemented good ideas, it seems he is very talented. I found his <a href="http://mattline1.blogspot.com/search/label/Sphere%20shooter">Sphere
shooter</a>
especially interesting, and I believe it nicely shows off that Blender can
actually be used for games too.</p>

    <content type="html" xml:base="http://www.natan.termitnjak.net/blog/2013/12/17/python-in-the-wide-world-week-day-2-dropbox"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, at the start of the very first "XXX week", we <a href="/blog/2013/12/16/python-in-the-wide-world-week-day-1-xbmc/">looked at
XBMC</a>. Today, we
will look at <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a>, a could storage file synchronisation service.</p>
<h2 id="dropbox"><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/"><img src="/images/dropbox_logo.png" alt="Dropbox"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> is a file hosting service that offers simple cloud storage and file
synchronisation for average users as well as big companies. From a humble start
in 2008 it grew faster then anyone could have predicted and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/11/13/dropbox-hits-200-million-users-and-announces-new-products-for-businesses/">hit 200M users on
Nov 13,
2013</a>.
Even though it has many competitors like <a href="http://www.google.com/drive/about.html">Google
Drive</a>, <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/skydrive/download">Microsoft
SkyDrive</a> and
<a href="https://www.box.com/">Box.net</a> (and many, many others), <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> continues to
stand at the top of the game.</p>
<h2 id="where-is-python-used">Where is Python used?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>It would have been virtually impossible to do Dropbox without Python</p>
<p>-- Rian Hunter, Dropbox Engineer</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The better question would be - where isn't it used? More then 99% of both the
server and client code is written in Python. Using Python allowed the engineers
to be able to quickly test their ideas, fix any problems and bring frequent
updates. They were lucky, as many of their Python solutions scaled surprisingly
well, which meant that "<em>(they) could get to 40M users without having to write
thousands of lines of C code</em>", as the whole platform was still running only a
few hundred lines of Python code even when the number of users started reaching
tens of millions.</p>
<p>Rian also said that every time they tried to anticipate things or "be clever in
advance", they failed - it was much easier to just stay on top of the
architecture as it grew and keep tabs on it, which probably wouldn't be
possible if they weren't using Python.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html" xml:base="http://www.natan.termitnjak.net/blog/2013/12/16/python-in-the-wide-world-week-day-1-xbmc"><![CDATA[<p>In an effort to actually post something here, I have decided to do a series of
"XXX week" posts. Starting off with a "Python in the wide world week", I'll be
exploring some interesting places where Python is used in the real world.</p>
<h2 id="xbmc"><a href="http://xbmc.org/">XBMC</a></h2>
<p><a href="http://xbmc.org/about/"><img src="/images/xbmc_about.jpg" alt="XBMC"></a></p>
<h3 id="what-is-xbmc">What is XBMC?</h3>
<p><a href="http://xbmc.org/">XBMC</a> is a free and <a href="https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc">open source</a> media player
developed by the <a href="http://xbmc.org/about/xbmc-foundation/">XBMC foundation</a>.
While it was originally created as a media center for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox">original Xbox gaming
console</a> (hence the name <strong>XB</strong>ox <strong>M</strong>edia
<strong>C</strong>enter), it is now natively available on Windows, various Linux
distributions, Mac OSX, Android, Raspberry Pi, iOS, Apple TV and Apple TV 2
(<a href="http://xbmc.org/download/">download link</a>). If that is not enough for you,
XMBC also features it's own (Ubuntu based) Linux distribution so you can easily
carry XBMC on your USB key/disk if you wish so.</p>
<p><a href="http://xbmc.org/">XBMC</a> became so popular that it spawned <a href="http://wiki.xbmc.org/index.php?title=Third-party_forks_and_derivatives">loads of
forks</a>,
many of which are now separate products with many users.</p>
<p>I personally use <a href="http://xbmc.org/">XBMC</a> on my Home Theatre PC (HTPC) for watching movies
comfortably, using my Android phone with
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.leetzone.android.yatsewidgetfree&amp;hl=en">Yatse</a>
as a remote.</p>
<h3 id="where-is-python-used">Where is Python used?</h3>
<p>The core for <a href="http://xbmc.org/">XBMC</a> is written in C++, but it <a href="http://wiki.xbmc.org/index.php?title=Python_development">uses
Python</a> for its many
wonderful <a href="http://addons.xbmc.org/">add-ons</a>, which offer everything from
scrapping for metadata, <a href="http://addons.xbmc.org/show/plugin.program.utorrent/">managing your torrent
downloads</a>, surfing the
web, checking <a href="http://addons.xbmc.org/category/weather/">the weather</a>, watching
YouTube or Twitch.tv, automatically downloading
<a href="http://addons.xbmc.org/category/lyrics/">lyrics</a> and (my personal favourite)
automatically downloading
<a href="http://addons.xbmc.org/show/script.xbmc.subtitles/">subtitles</a>.</p>
<p>Believe me, once you get used to quickly and easily getting the subtitles you
won't want to go back to surfing the web, downloading the files, extracting
them, pulling them to the player ...</p>]]></content>
