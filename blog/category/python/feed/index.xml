      <description>Python in the wide world week - day 2, Dropbox</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, at the start of the very first "XXX week", we <a href="/blog/2013/12/16/python-in-the-wide-world-week-day-1-xbmc/">looked at
XBMC</a>. Today, we
will look at <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a>, a could storage file synchronisation service.</p>
<h2 id="dropbox"><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/"><img src="/images/dropbox_logo.png" alt="Dropbox"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> is a file hosting service that offers simple cloud storage and file
synchronisation for average users as well as big companies. From a humble start
in 2008 it grew faster then anyone could have predicted and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/11/13/dropbox-hits-200-million-users-and-announces-new-products-for-businesses/">hit 200M users on
Nov 13,
2013</a>.
Even though it has many competitors like <a href="http://www.google.com/drive/about.html">Google
Drive</a>, <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/skydrive/download">Microsoft
SkyDrive</a> and
<a href="https://www.box.com/">Box.net</a> (and many, many others), <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> continues to
stand at the top of the game.</p>
<h2 id="where-is-python-used">Where is Python used?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>It would have been virtually impossible to do Dropbox without Python</p>
<p>-- Rian Hunter, Dropbox Engineer</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The better question would be - where isn't it used? More then 99% of both the
server and client code is written in Python. Using Python allowed the engineers
to be able to quickly test their ideas, fix any problems and bring frequent
updates. They were lucky, as many of their Python solutions scaled surprisingly
well, which meant that "<em>(they) could get to 40M users without having to write
thousands of lines of C code</em>", as the whole platform was still running only a
few hundred lines of Python code even when the number of users started reaching
tens of millions.</p>
<p>Rian also said that every time they tried to anticipate things or "be clever in
advance", they failed - it was much easier to just stay on top of the
architecture as it grew and keep tabs on it, which probably wouldn't be
possible if they weren't using Python.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>Python in the wide world week - day 1, XBMC</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In an effort to actually post something here, I have decided to do a series of
"XXX week" posts. Starting off with a "Python in the wide world week", I'll be
exploring some interesting places where Python is used in the real world.</p>
<h2 id="xbmc"><a href="http://xbmc.org/">XBMC</a></h2>
<p><a href="http://xbmc.org/about/"><img src="/images/xbmc_about.jpg" alt="XBMC"></a></p>
<h3 id="what-is-xbmc">What is XBMC?</h3>
<p><a href="http://xbmc.org/">XBMC</a> is a free and <a href="https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc">open source</a> media player
developed by the <a href="http://xbmc.org/about/xbmc-foundation/">XBMC foundation</a>.
While it was originally created as a media center for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox">original Xbox gaming
console</a> (hence the name <strong>XB</strong>ox <strong>M</strong>edia
<strong>C</strong>enter), it is now natively available on Windows, various Linux
distributions, Mac OSX, Android, Raspberry Pi, iOS, Apple TV and Apple TV 2
(<a href="http://xbmc.org/download/">download link</a>). If that is not enough for you,
XMBC also features it's own (Ubuntu based) Linux distribution so you can easily
carry XBMC on your USB key/disk if you wish so.</p>
<p><a href="http://xbmc.org/">XBMC</a> became so popular that it spawned <a href="http://wiki.xbmc.org/index.php?title=Third-party_forks_and_derivatives">loads of
forks</a>,
many of which are now separate products with many users.</p>
<p>I personally use <a href="http://xbmc.org/">XBMC</a> on my Home Theatre PC (HTPC) for watching movies
comfortably, using my Android phone with
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.leetzone.android.yatsewidgetfree&amp;hl=en">Yatse</a>
as a remote.</p>
<h3 id="where-is-python-used">Where is Python used?</h3>
<p>The core for <a href="http://xbmc.org/">XBMC</a> is written in C++, but it <a href="http://wiki.xbmc.org/index.php?title=Python_development">uses
Python</a> for its many
wonderful <a href="http://addons.xbmc.org/">add-ons</a>, which offer everything from
scrapping for metadata, <a href="http://addons.xbmc.org/show/plugin.program.utorrent/">managing your torrent
downloads</a>, surfing the
web, checking <a href="http://addons.xbmc.org/category/weather/">the weather</a>, watching
YouTube or Twitch.tv, automatically downloading
<a href="http://addons.xbmc.org/category/lyrics/">lyrics</a> and (my personal favourite)
automatically downloading
<a href="http://addons.xbmc.org/show/script.xbmc.subtitles/">subtitles</a>.</p>
<p>Believe me, once you get used to quickly and easily getting the subtitles you
won't want to go back to surfing the web, downloading the files, extracting
them, pulling them to the player ...</p>]]></content:encoded>
